\screenshot{plugins/images/ss-goban}{Goban}{The Rockbox Goban plugin}
Goban is a a plugin for playing, viewing and recording games of Go (also known
as Weiqi, Baduk, Igo and Goe).  It uses standard Smart Game Format (SGF) files
for saving and loading games.  You can find a short introduction to Go at
\url{http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo} and more information about SGF files
can be read at \url{http://senseis.xmp.net/?SmartGameFormat} or the SGF
specification at \url{http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/}.\\

This plugin can load all modern SGF files (file format 3 or 4) with few problems.
It attempts to preserve SGF properties which it doesn't understand, and most common
SGF properties are handled fully.  It is possible to view (and edit if you like)
Kogo's Joseki Dictionary (\url{http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm}) with this plugin,
although the load and save times can be on the order of a minute or two on
particularly slow devices.  Large SGF files may stop audio playback for the duration
of the plugin's run in order to free up more memory and some very large SGF files will
not even load on devices with little available memory.\\

\note{The plugin does \emph{NOT} support SGF files with multiple games in
one file.  These are rare, but if you have one don't even try it (the file will most
likely be corrupted if you save over it). You have been warned.\\}

The file \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} is used by the plugin to store any unsaved
changes in the most recently loaded game.  This means that if you forget to save your
changes, you should load \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} immediately to offload the changes
to another file.  If you load another file first then your changes will be lost
permanently.  The \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} file is also the file loaded if another
is not selected.\\

The information panel which displays the current move number may also contain
these markers: 

\begin{table}

            to be read by other SGF readers.
        \item[Event.] The name of the event which this game was a part of, if any.
        \item[Place.] The place that this game took place.
        \item[Round.] If part of a tournament, the round number for this game.
        \item[Done.] Return to the previous menu.
    \end{description}

\item [Options. ]
    Customize the behavior of the plugin in certain ways.
    \begin{description}
        \item[Show Child Variations?] Enable this to mark child variations on 
            he board if there are more than one.  Note: variations which don't
            start with a move are not visible in this way.
        \item[Disable Idle Poweroff?] Enable this if you do not want the \dap{}
            to turn off after a certain period of inactivity (depends on your
            global Rockbox settings).
        \item[Idle Autosave Time.] Set the amount of idle time to wait before
            automatically saving any unsaved changes.  These autosaves go to
            the file \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} regardless of if you have
            loaded a game or used \setting{Save As} to save the game before or
            not.  Set to \setting{Off} to disable this functionality completely.
        \item[Automatically Show Comments?] If this is enabled and you navigate
            to a node containing game comments, they will automatically be
            displayed.
    \end{description}

\item [Context Menu. ]
    The menu for choosing different play modes and tools, adding or editing
    comments, adding pass moves, or switching between sibling variations.
    \begin{description}
        \item[Play Mode.] Play moves normally on the board. If there are child
            moves from the current node, this mode will let you follow
            variations by simply playing the first move in the sequence.
            Unless it is following a variation, this mode will not allow you to
            play illegal moves. This is the default mode before another is set
            after loading a game or creating a new one.
        \item[Add Black Mode.] Add black stones to the board as desired. These
            stones are not moves and do not perform captures or count as ko threats.
        \item[Add White Mode.] Add white stones to the board as desired. These
            stones are not moves and do not perform captures or count as ko threats.
        \item[Erase Stone Mode.] Remove stones from the board as desired. These
            removed stones are not counted as captured, they are simply removed.
        \item[Pass.] Play a single pass move.  This does not change the mode of
            play.
        \item[Next Variation.] If the game is at the first move in a variation,
            this will navigate to the next variation after the current one. This
            is the only way to reach variations which start with adding or
            removing stones, as you cannot follow them by "playing" the same move.
        \item[Force Play Mode.] The same as Play Mode except that this mode will
            allow you to play illegal moves such as retaking a ko immediately
            without a ko threat, suicide on rulesets which don't allow it
            (including single stone suicide), and playing a move where there
            is already a stone.
        \item[Mark Mode.] Add generic marks to the board, or remove them.
        \item[Circle Mode.] Add circle marks to the board, or remove them.
        \item[Square Mode.] Add square marks to the board, or remove them.
        \item[Triangle Mode.] Add triangle marks to the board, or remove them.
        \item[Label Mode.] Add one character labels to the board. Each label
            starts at the letter 'a' and each subsequent application of a label
            will increment the letter.  To remove a label, click on it until it
            cycles through the allowed letters and disappears.
        \item[Add/Edit Comment.] Add or edit a comment at the current node.
        \item[Done.] Go back to the previous screen.
    \end{description}
