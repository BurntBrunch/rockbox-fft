\subsection{PictureFlow}
\screenshot{plugins/images/ss-pictureflow}{PictureFlow}{img:pictureflow}
PictureFlow provides a visualisation of your albums with their associated cover
art. \opt{swcodec}{It is possible to start playback of the selected
album from PictureFlow. Playback will start from the selected track. The 
PictureFlow plugin will continue to run while your tracks are played.}

\opt{hwcodec}{
\note{PictureFlow is a visualisation only. It cannot be used to select and
play music.  Also, using this plugin will cause playback to stop.}
}

\subsubsection{Requirements}
PictureFlow uses both the album art (see \reference{ref:album_art}) and 
database (see \reference{ref:database}) features of Rockbox.
It is therefore important that these are working correctly before attempting
to use PictureFlow. In addition, there are some other points of which to be
aware:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item PictureFlow will accept album art larger than the dimensions of the
    screen, but the larger the dimensions, the longer they will take to scale.
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Main Menu}
\begin{description}
  \item[Go to WPS.] Leave PictureFlow and enter the while playing screen.
  \opt{swcodec}{\item[Playback Control.] Control music playback from within the plugin.}
  \item[Settings.] Enter the settings menu.
  \item[Return.] Exit menu.
  \item[Quit.] Exit PictureFlow plugin.

\subsubsection{Settings Menu}

\begin{description}
  \item[Show FPS.] Displays frames per second on screen.
  \item[Spacing.] The distance between the front edges of the side slides, i.e. changes
  the degree of overlap of the side slides. A larger number means less overlap. Scales with zoom.
  \item[Centre margin.] The distance, in screen pixels, with zoom at 100, between
  the centre and side slides. Scales with zoom.
  \item[Number of slides.] Sets the number of slides at each side, including the
  centre slide. Therefore if set to 4, there will be 3 slides on the left,
  the centre slide, and then 3 slides on the right.
  \item[Zoom.] Changes the distance at which slides are rendered from the "camera".
  \item[Show album title.] Allows setting the album title to be shown above or
  below the cover art, or not at all.
  \item[Resize Covers.] Set whether to automatically resize the covers or to leave
  them at their original size.
  \item[Rebuild cache.] Rebuild the PictureFlow cache. This is needed in order
  for PictureFlow to pick up new albums, and may occasionally be needed if albums
  are removed.
