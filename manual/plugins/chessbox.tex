Chessbox is a one-person chess game with computer artificial intelligence. 
The chess engine is a port of GNU Chess 2 by John Stanback.

It also works as a PGN file viewer. Instead of executing the game from the
plugin menu, look for any file with \fname{.pgn} extension in the file browser
and execute it. Chessbox will show the list of matches included in the file
and allow you to select the one you want to watch. After that, you can scroll
back and forth through the moves of the game. If the menu is invoked while in
the viewer, the user is allowed to select a new match from the same file or
quit the game.

``Force play'' while the computer is thinking will cause it to make its move
immediately.  If done while it's your turn, the computer will move
for you and flip the board so that you are playing from the other side.  If you
want, you can force play an entire game and watch the artificial intelligence
 fight against itself.

When you quit the game the current state will be saved and restored when
you resume the game. The menu also allows the user to reload the last game
saved, save the current position and start a new game without having to quit
the game.
