Rockpaint is a bitmap (\fname{.bmp}) editor for Rockbox. It can open any \fname{.bmp} file
whose dimensions are the same size as your device's screen or smaller; it can
also create empty bitmaps for you to work with.\\

\subsubsection{Opening A File}
To open a file, you may use either the context menu option "Open With" in the
File Browser, or you may enter Rockpaint first using the Plugins menu and open
a file from there. To perform the latter, simply press Rockpaint's Menu button
or move the cursor beyond the bottom of the screen; then move the cursor onto
"Menu" and select it. Finally, select "Load" and navigate to the image you
wish to open.\\

\subsubsection{Tools}
Rockpaint offers several tools to aid you in editing; you can view them by
either pressing Rockpaint's "Menu" key or by attempting to move the cursor
beyond the bottom of the screen. From top to bottom and left to right, and
by section, they are as follows:
\begin{description}
    \item[Colour Picker]
        The top left tool shows your colours that are at the ready. To
        swap them, "click" on the background colour. To edit the foreground colour,
        click on it.
    \item[Preset Pallete]
        Several preset colours are availible. Clicking on one changes
        the foreground of the Colour Picker to the selected colour.
    \item[Pencil]
        Draws as you move the cursor. You can change the brush size with the
        Menu option "Brush Size". Use the Select key to toggle the tool while editing
        the image.
    \item[Selection tool]
        Allows you to select a rectangular region; once you do, you
        will be shown a menu of options (including "cancel" if you make a mistake).
    \item[Line tool]
        Draws a straight line.
    \item[Curve tool]
        Allows you to draw a line and curve it.
    \item[Rectangle tool]
        Draws an unfilled rectangle.
    \item[Circle tool]
        Draws an unfilled circle.
    \item[Gradient fill]
        To use this tool, click at the starting and ending points.
        Starting with the background and going to the foreground colour, Rockpaint
        will fill the region with a gradual colour change.
    \item[Bucket fill]
        Fills an same-colour or empty region with a colour.
    \item[Dropper]
        Click on a colour in the image to change the foreground colour to it.
    \item[Eraser]
        The opposite of the pencil; it changes painted pixels to white.
    \item[Text tool]
        "Draws" text on the image.
    \item[Filled rectangle]
        Same as the Rectangle tool, but fills it with colour.
    \item[Filled circle]
        Same as the Circle tool, but fills it with colour.
    \item[Curved Gradient Fill]
        Same as Gradient fill, but you must draw two lines.
        Rockpaint will draw a curved, gradual change of colour in the region.
    \item[Menu]
        This opens the Main Menu. You can also press the Menu key to open it.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Main Menu}
The main menu consists of the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Resume]
        Closes the Main Menu.
    \item[New]
        Creates a new canvas and discards the current file. BE CAREFUL.
        You will lose any unsaved changes in the file that is currently open.
    \item[Load]
        Loads a bitmap file. Simply navigate to the file as you
        would in the file browser.
    \item[Save]
        Saves the current file. If it has not been saved before,
        you will be given a chance to name it and choose the saving location.
    \item[Set Width]
        Allows you to change the width of the image.
        Border to indicate the width will be shown but it doesn't affect drawing.
    \item[Set Height]
        Allows you to change the height of the image.
        Border to indicate the height will be shown but it doesn't affect drawing.
    \item[Brush speed]
        Changes the speed at which the selection cursor
        moves when you hold down a movement button.
    \item[Brush size]
        Allows you to adjust the drawing size of the pencil tool.
    \item[Choose colour]
        Allows you to manually edit the foreground colour.
        You can edit the RBG and/or the HSV values.
    \item[Grid size]
        Allows you to show or hide a grid over the canvas,
        and to specify its size.
    \item[Exit]
        Exits Rockpaint.
\end{description}

\warn{BE CAREFUL. Rockpaint will NOT prompt you to save
if you select Exit, so any unsaved changes will be lost.}
