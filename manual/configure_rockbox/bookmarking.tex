\section{\label{ref:Bookmarkconfigactual}Bookmarking}
  Bookmarks allow you to save your current position within a track so that 
  you can return to it at a later time. Bookmarks are saved on a per directory
  basis (for dynamic playlists) or for individual (saved) playlists. They are 
  stored next to the directory/playlist they reference.
  You can store multiple bookmarks for the same track.\\*
  
  \note{Bookmarking only works when tracks are launched from the file browser,
        and does not currently work for tracks launched via the
        database.\\*}

  \item [Bookmark on Stop.] This option controls whether Rockbox writes a
    bookmark to the disk when playback is stopped. Setting this to
    \setting{No} turns automatic bookmarking completely off. In contrast
    \setting{Yes} turns automatic bookmarking on while \setting{Ask} 
    asks on stopping the track if a bookmark should be created.
    With the above options \setting{Yes} and \setting{Ask} if there is an existing 
    \fname{.bmark} file the current position information will be added to the
    front of the existing list, up to the maximum number of allowed bookmarks
    per file (currently 10). If no \fname{.bmark} file exists, one will be
    created with the new bookmark information. Finally, if the 
    \setting{Maintain a list of Recently Used Bookmarks}
     option is enabled, the bookmarking
    information will be added to recent bookmarks list.
    \begin{description}    
      \item[Yes -- Recent Only.]
            Turns on automatic bookmarking -- One bookmark only
      \item[Ask -- Recent Only.]
            Asks if a bookmark should be created when stopping track -- 
            One bookmark only
    \end{description}
    With the two \setting{Recent Only} options, nothing is written to the 
    \fname{.bmark} file. If the \setting{Maintain a list of Recently Used Bookmarks}
    option is enabled, the bookmarking information will however be added to
    recent bookmarks list. 
    \note{The \setting{Resume} function remembers your position in the most
      recently accessed track regardless of how the \setting{Bookmark on Stop}
      option is set.}
    
  \item [Load Last Bookmark.]

  When the \setting{Load Last Bookmark} option is set to \setting{Yes}, Rockbox
  automatically returns to the position of the last bookmark within a file
  when that file is played. 

  When the \setting{Load Last Bookmark} option is set to \setting{Ask}, Rockbox will
  give the user the option of starting from the beginning of the track
  of or from the bookmark. 

  When the \setting{Load Last Bookmark} option is set to \setting{No}, playback always
  starts from the beginning of the track, and the user must play the bookmark
  or use the \setting{Load Bookmark} function in the Main Menu, while the file
  is playing, to resume at the bookmarked location.
    
  \item [Maintain a list of Recently Used Bookmarks.]

  This list of Most Recent Bookmarks (MRB's) may be accessed through the
  \setting{Recent Bookmarks} option of the \setting{Bookmarks} sub menu of the 
  Main Menu. When set to \setting{Yes} each new bookmark will be added to the
  MRB list. Setting this to \setting{No} disables the addition of bookmarks to
  the MRB list. \setting{Unique Only} behaves like the \setting{Yes} setting 
  but in addition all older entries for the current (dynamic) playlist will 
  be removed from the MRB whenever a new entry is added.
  
  \item [Bookmark list keys.] The following keys can be used to navigate in
  any bookmark list.\\
\begin{table}
    \begin{btnmap}{}{}
      \ActionStdNext
      \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& \ActionRCStdNext}
      & Selects the next bookmark.\\
      %
      \ActionStdPrev
      \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& \ActionRCStdPrev}
      & Selects the previous bookmark.\\
      %
      \ActionStdOk
      \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& \ActionRCStdOk}
      & Resumes from the selected bookmark.\\
      %
      \ActionStdCancel
      \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& \ActionRCStdCancel}
      & Exits Recent Bookmark menu\\
      %
      \nopt{GIGABEAT_S_PAD}{\ActionBmDelete
      \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& \ActionRCBmDelete}
      & Deletes the currently selected bookmark\\}
      %
      \ActionStdContext
      \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& \ActionRCStdContext}
      & Enters the context menu for the selected bookmark.\\
    \end{btnmap}
\end{table}

There are two options in the context menu:\\*
  
  \setting{Resume} will commence playback of the currently selected bookmark entry.
  
  \setting{Delete} will remove the currently selected bookmark entry from the list.
