    \section{\label{ref:Hotkeys}Hotkeys}
    Hotkeys are user-assignable shortcut keys to functions within the
    \setting{File Browser} and \setting{WPS Context Menus}.  To use one,
    press \ActionWpsHotkey  within the \setting{File Browser} or
    \setting{WPS} screens.  The assigned function will launch with
    reference to the current file or directory, if applicable.  Each
    screen has its own assignment.  If there is no assignment for
    a given screen, the message "No Hotkey Set" appears briefly.
    
    There is no default assignment for the File Browser hotkey, but the WPS
    hotkey defaults to View Playlist.
    
    To change the assignment of a hotkey, go into the associated
    \setting{Context Menu} from the File Browser or WPS screen by pressing
    \ActionWpsContext, then highlighting the function you wish to assign.
    Press the hotkey (\ActionWpsHotkey) and if the function you've chosen
    is assignable a confirmation dialog screen will appear.  Press
    \ActionYesNoAccept  to confirm the assignment or anything else to reject
    it.  If accepted, you'll see a short message confirming your choice.
    
    You can view the current assignments and reset to the default assignments
    from the Hotkey menu under General Settings. See \reference{ref:HotkeySettings}
    for details.
