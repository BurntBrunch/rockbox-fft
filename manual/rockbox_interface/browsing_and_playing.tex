\section{\label{ref:file_browser}File Browser}
\screenshot{rockbox_interface/images/ss-file-browser}{The file browser}{}
Rockbox lets you browse your music in either of two ways. The 
\setting{File Browser} lets you navigate through the files and directories on 
your \dap, entering directories and executing the default action on each file.
To help differentiate files, each file format is displayed with an icon. 

The \setting{Database Browser}, on the other hand, allows you to navigate 
through the music on your player using categories like album, artist, genre,
etc.

You can select whether to browse using the \setting{File Browser} or the
\setting{Database Browser} by selecting either \setting{Files} or
\setting{Database} in the \setting{Main Menu}.
If you choose the \setting{File Browser}, the \setting{Show Files} setting
lets you select what types of files you wish to view. See
\reference{ref:ShowFiles} for more information on the \setting{Show Files}
setting.

\note{The \setting{File Browser} allows you to manipulate your files in ways
that are not available within the \setting{Database Browser}. Read more about
\setting{Database} in \reference{ref:database}. The remainder of this section
deals with the \setting{File Browser}.}

\opt{ondio}{
Unlike the Archos Firmware, Rockbox provides multivolume support for the
MultiMediaCard, this means the \dap{} can access both data volumes (internal
memory and the MMC), thus being able to for instance, build playlists with
files from both volumes.
In the \setting{File Browser} a new directory will appear as soon as the device
has read the content after inserting the card. This new directory's name is
generated as \fname{<MMC1>}, and will behave exactly as any other directory
on the \dap{}.
}

\opt{h10,h10_5gb}{\note{
If your \dap{} is a MTP model, the Music directory where all your music is stored
may be hidden in the \setting{File Browser}. This may be fixed by either
either changing its properties (on a computer) to not hidden, or by changing
the \setting{Show Files} setting to all.

\subsection{\label{ref:Contextmenu}\label{ref:PartIISectionFM}Context Menu}
\screenshot{rockbox_interface/images/ss-context-menu}{The Context Menu}{}

The \setting{Context Menu} allows you to perform certain operations on files or 
directories.  To access the \setting{Context Menu}, position the selector over a file 
or directory and access the context menu with \ActionStdContext{}.\\

\note{The \setting{Context Menu} is a context sensitive menu.  If the 
\setting{Context Menu} is invoked on a file, it will display options available 
for files.  If the \setting{Context Menu} is invoked on a directory, 
it will display options for directories.\\}

The \setting{Context Menu} contains the following options (unless otherwise noted, 
each option pertains both to files and directories):

\begin{description}
\item [Playlist.]
  Enters the \setting{Playlist Submenu} (see \reference{ref:playlist_submenu}).
\item [Playlist Catalog.]
  Enters the \setting{Playlist Catalog Submenu} (see 
  \reference{ref:playlist_catalog}).
\item [Rename.]
  This function lets the user modify the name of a file or directory.
\item [Cut.]
  Copies the name of the currently selected file or directory to the clipboard
  and marks it to be `cut'.
\item [Copy.]
  Copies the name of the currently selected file or directory to the clipboard
  and marks it to be `copied'.
\item [Paste.]
  Only visible if a file or directory name is on the clipboard. When selected
  it will move or copy the clipboard to the current directory.
\item [Delete.]
  Deletes the currently selected file. This option applies only to files, and
  not to directories. Rockbox will ask for confirmation before deleting a file.
  Press \ActionYesNoAccept{}
  to confirm deletion or any other key to cancel.
\item [Delete Directory.]
  Deletes the currently selected directory and all of the files and subdirectories
  it may contain. Deleted directories cannot be recovered. Use this feature with
  caution!
\opt{lcd_non-mono}{
\item [Set As Backdrop.]
  Set the selected \fname{bmp} file as background image. The bitmaps need to meet the
  conditions explained in \reference{ref:LoadingBackdrops}.
}
\item [Open with.]
  Runs a viewer plugin on the file. Normally, when a file is selected in Rockbox,
  Rockbox automatically detects the file type and runs the appropriate plugin.
  The \setting{Open With} function can be used to override the default action and
  select a viewer by hand.
  For example, this function can be used to view a text file
  even if the file has a non-standard extension (i.e., the file has an extension
  of something other than \fname{.txt}). See \reference{ref:Viewersplugins}
  for more details on viewers.
\item [Create Directory.]
  Create a new directory in the current directory on the disk.
\item [Properties.]
  Shows properties such as size and the time and date of the last modification
  for the selected file. If used on a directory, the number of files and
  subdirectories will be shown, as well as the total size.
\opt{recording}{
  \item [Set As Recording Directory.]
    Save recordings in the selected directory.
}
\item [Add to Shortcuts.]
  Adds a link to the selected item in the \fname{shortcuts.link} file.
  If the file does not already exist it will be created in the root directory.
  Note that if you create a shortcut to a file, Rockbox will not open it upon
  selecting, but simply bring you to it's location in the \setting{File Browser}.

\subsection{\label{sec:virtual_keyboard}Virtual Keyboard}
\screenshot{rockbox_interface/images/ss-virtual-keyboard}{The virtual keyboard}{}
This is the virtual keyboard that is used when entering text in Rockbox, for 
example when renaming a file or creating a new directory.
\nopt{player}{The virtual keyboard can be easily changed by making a text file
 with the required layout. More information on how to achieve this can be found
 on the Rockbox website at \wikilink{LoadableKeyboardLayouts}.}
