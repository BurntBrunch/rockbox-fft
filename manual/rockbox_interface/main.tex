\subsection{Putting music on your \dap{}}

\opt{usb_hid}{
\note{Due to a bug in some OS X versions, the \dap{} can not be mounted, unless
    the USB HID feature is disabled. See \reference{ref:USB_HID} for more
    information.\newline
}
}

With the \dap{} connected to the computer as an MSC/UMS device (like a
USB Drive), music files can be put on the player via any standard file
transfer method that you would use to copy files between drives (e.g. Drag 'n' Drop).
The default directory structure that is assumed by some parts of Rockbox
\opt{albumart}{%
    (album art searching, and missing-tag fallback in some WPSes) uses the
    parent directory of a song as the Album name, and the parent directory of
    that folder as the Artist name. While files may be organized however you
    like, see \reference{ref:album_art} for the requirements for Album
    Art to work properly, and WPSes may display information incorrectly if your
    files are not properly tagged, and you have your music organized in a way
    different than they assume when attempting to guess the Artist and Album
    names from your filetree.

\subsection{The first contact}

After you have first started the \dap{}, you'll be presented by the
\setting{Main Menu}. From this menu you can reach every function of Rockbox,
for more information (see \reference{ref:main_menu}). To browse the files
on you \dap{}, select \setting{Files} (see \reference{ref:file_browser}), and to
browse in a view that is based on the meta-data\footnote{ID3 Tags, Vorbis
comments, etc.} of your audio files, select \setting{Database} (see
\reference{ref:database}).

\subsection{Basic controls}
When browsing files and moving through menus you usually get a list view
presented. The navigation in these lists are usually the same and should be
pretty intuitive.
In the tree view use \ActionStdNext{} and \ActionStdPrev{} to move around
the selection. Use \ActionStdOk{} to select an item. When browsing the file
system selecting an audio file plays it. The view switches to the ``While
playing screen'', usually abbreviated as ``WPS'' (see \reference{ref:WPS}. The
dynamic playlist gets replaced with the contents of the current directory. This
way you can easily treat directories as playlists. The created dynamic playlist can
be extended or modified while playing. This is also known as
``on-the-fly playlist''.
To go back to the \setting{File Browser} stop the playback with the
\ActionWpsStop{} button or return to the file browser while keeping playback
running using \ActionWpsBrowse{}.
In list views you can go back one step with \ActionTreeParentDirectory.

\subsection{Basic concepts}
\subsubsection{Playlists}
Rockbox is playlist oriented. This means that every time you play an audio file,
a so-called ``dynamic playlist'' is generated, unless you play a saved
playlist. You can modify the dynamic playlist while playing and also save
it to a file. If you do not want to use playlists you can simply play your
files directory based.
Playlists are covered in detail in \reference{ref:working_with_playlists}.

\subsubsection{Menu}
From the menu you can customise Rockbox. Rockbox itself is very customisable.
Also there are some special menus for quick access to frequently used
functions.

\subsubsection{Context Menu}
Some views, especially the file browser and the WPS have a context menu.
From the file browser this can be accessed with \ActionStdContext{}.
The contents of the context menu vary, depending on the situation it gets
called. The context menu itself presents you with some operations you can
perform with the currently highlighted file. In the file browser this is
the file (or directory) that is highlighted by the cursor. From the WPS this is
the currently playing file. Also there are some actions that do not apply
to the current file but refer to the screen from which the context menu
gets called. One example is the playback menu, which can be called using
the context menu from within the WPS.

\section{Customising Rockbox}
Rockbox' User Interface can be customised using ``Themes''. Themes usually
only affect the visual appearance, but an advanced user can create a theme
that also changes various other settings like file view, LCD settings and
all other settings that can be modified using \fname{.cfg} files. This topic
is discussed in more detail in \reference{ref:manage_settings}.
The Rockbox distribution comes with some themes that should look nice on
your \dap{}.
\opt{lcd_bitmap}{
\note{Some of the themes shipped with Rockbox need additional
fonts from the fonts package, so make sure you installed them.
Also, if you downloaded additional themes from the Internet make sure you
have the needed fonts installed as otherwise the theme may not display
properly.}

    \section{Charging}

    The \dap{} can be powered over USB without connecting to your
    computer by holding \ActionStdUsbCharge{} while plugging in. This
    allows you to continue using the \dap{} normally.
