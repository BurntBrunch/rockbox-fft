  \note{The early V2 models were in fact FM Recorders in disguise,
  so they had the FM radio still mounted. Rockbox enables it if present -
  in case this menu does not show on your unit you can skip this chapter.\\}

  \note{Not all Sansas have a radio receiver. Generally all american models do,
  but european models might not. Rockbox will display the radio menu only if it
  can find a radio receiver in your Sansa.}

\screenshot{main_menu/images/ss-fm-radio-screen}{The FM radio screen}{}
  This menu option switches to the radio screen.
  The FM radio has the ability to remember station frequency settings
  (presets). Since stations and their frequencies vary depending on location,
  it is possible to load these settings from a file. Such files should have
  the filename extension \fname{.fmr} and reside in the directory
  \fname{/.rockbox/fmpresets} (note that this directory does not exist after
  the initial Rockbox installation; you should create it manually). To load
  the settings, i.e. a set of FM stations, from a preset file, just ``play''
  it from the file browser. Rockbox will ``remember'' and use it in
  \setting{PRESET} mode until another file has been selected. Some preset
  files are available here: \wikilink{FmPresets}

         It is also possible to record the FM radio while listening.
         To start recording, enter the FM radio settings menu with
         \ActionFMMenu{} and then select \setting{Recording}.
         At this point, you will be switched to the \setting{Recording Screen}.
         Further information on \setting{Recording} can be found in
         \reference{ref:Recording}.
