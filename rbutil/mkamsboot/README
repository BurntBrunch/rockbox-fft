mkamsboot
---------

A tool to inject a bootloader into a Sansa V2 (AMS) firmware file.


Usage
-----

mkamsboot <firmware file> <boot file> <output file>

<firmware file> is an original Sansa firmware file obtained from the Sansa
    forums for example : http://forums.sandisk.com/sansa/?category.id=devices

<boot file> is the code you want to execute (a rockbox bootloader), previously
    scrambled with tools/scramble utility.

<output file> is the resulting firmware file which you'll have to copy on your
    Sansa player. See "Firmware filenames".


Supported models
----------------

Sansa Clip  :   firmware version starting with "01."
Sansa Clip+ :   firmware version starting with "01."
Sansa Clipv2:   firmware version starting with "02."
Sansa Fuze  :   firmware version starting with "01."
Sansa Fuzev2:   firmware version starting with "02."
Sansa E200v2:   firmware version starting with "03."
Sansa C200v2:   firmware version starting with "03."
Sansa M200v4:   firmware version starting with "4."


Firmware filenames
------------------

For the firmware upgrade to happen, the firmware has to be named specially:

clip v2 :   m30pa.bin
clip    :   m300a.bin
clip+   :   clppa.bin
fuze    :   fuzea.bin
fuzev2  :   fuzpa.bin
e200v2  :   e200pa.bin
c200v2  :   c200pa.bin
m200v4  :   m200a.bin


Dual-Boot
---------

  The purpose of this program is to provide dual-boot between the original
firmware and the new (rockbox) firmware.

  By default the player will boot into the new firmware.

  To boot into the Original Firmware, you need to press the Left key.
  ***Note : on the c200v2 you need to press the Right key.
  ***Note : on the Clip+ you can alternatively press the Home key.

  The player will boot into the Original Firmware as well if it is powered up by
inserting an usb cable.
  ***Note : on the m200v4 and Clip+, powering up by usb will cause booting into
the new firmware.
