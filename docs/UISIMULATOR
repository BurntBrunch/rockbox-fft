                               How to build the UISimulators

1. Get Sources

  Get the very latest sources off the SVN server (or possibly get a recent
  source code tarball).

  All SVN details can be found here:
  http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/UsingSVN

2. Build Uisimulator

    Create a new directory and run the 'tools/configure' script in
    there. Select target to simulate and select simulation. The script will
    then generate a Makefile for you:
 
        $ mkdir build-dir
        $ cd build-dir
        $ ../tools/configure

        [ answer to questions ]

        [ Makefile created, simdisk subdirectory created ]

        $ make
        $ make install
        $ ./rockboxui

    Note that the simulator uses a local subdirectory named 'simdisk' as "root
    directory" for the simulated box. Copy a bunch of mp3 files into that
    directory, create subdirectories and do all sorts of things you want to be
    able to browse when you fire up the simulator.

3. Run Uisimulator

  To create a simulated disk drive for the simulator to see, create a
  subdirectory named 'simdisk' and populate it with a bunch of test
  files/directories.

  Run 'rockboxui'.

4. Target Keypad Equivalents

  The keyboard's numerical keypad is used to simulate the target keypad. See
  the output rockboxui displays on start for details.

5. Mouse Input

  Clicking on the button images on the background will simulate pressing the
  appropriate buttons.  On scroll wheel targts the mouse wheel will simulate
  scroll wheel motion.
