time-sync is a utility to sync the time with any Rockbox target that runs the
software USB stack.

It was originally take from libgpod and stripped of unnecessary code.

To compile and install, just run:
    make
    make install

Example run:
    mcuelenaere@wim2160:~/rockbox/utils/time-sync$ sudo time-sync /dev/sdb1
	Data Payload: 07 da 00 14 04 0c 30 2b 00 00 00 00
	Write buffer cmd: 3b 01 00 0c 00 00 00 00 0c 00
    Time was synced!

Example udev rule (for Onda VX747):
    # automatically adjust my Rockboxed DAP RTC
    ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="07c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a4a5", KERNEL=="sd?", NAME="%k", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/time-sync /dev/%k"
